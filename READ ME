This lab was made by Nathan Spencer and Izzy Furl.

Completed Parts of the lab:
Physically based object movement - 2 points possible
  -Objects update their position and velocity using acceleration - 2/2 points

Object management - 2 points possible ; split between two categories, requirement must be met to earn the corresponding point
  Scene can spawn new objects/particles and run indefinitely by culling or reinitializing objects/particles past their maxAge - 1 point/1 point
  Objects somehow change over time (ex: color, shape, or transparency) - 1 point/1 point

Object emitter variation - 1 point possible
  Object emitter is parameterized (user input can somehow change properties of how objects/particles are spawned ; 
                ex: spawn from a fixed area or volume instead of a fixed point, change range of initial velocities, change average maxAge, etc.) - 1 point/1 point
Collision detection - 2 points possible
Objects collide with non-axis aligned plane(s) OR with other objects - 2 points/2 points

Collision response - 2 points possible
  Objects respond to collisions in a physically correct or interesting way - 2 point/2 points

Documentation and lab submission process - 1 point possible

All portions listed above have been completed.
